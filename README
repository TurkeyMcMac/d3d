OVERVIEW
--------
This is a 3D ray casting graphics library meant to draw dungeons and other
square maze-like structures. It is intended for use with libcurses-based
graphics, but it can be easily integrated with another drawing system.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
Documentation is in d3d.h. The demo is under the 'demo' directory.

USAGE
-----
To use this in another project, just copy in some files. d3d.c expects d3d.h and
d3d-internal-structures.h to be in the same directory as it is. If this is not
what you want, you can use the make-standalone executable, which requires awk to
run. This bundles the headers in with d3d.c. If you just want to bundle
d3d-internal-structures, use the --exclude-d3d.h option of the executable. The
preprocessed code is printed to the standard output.

DEPENDENCIES
------------
This library depends only on the standard library and the standard math library
(compile/link it with -lm.) The demo depends on libcurses for actually drawing
the pixels.
