This demonstration shows a use of the library. Walls and empty spaces are shown,
along with sprites. Methods of sprite movement and animation are used as well.
The actual rendering is done by Curses. The code is located in 'demo.c'. You can
see the controls at the top of that file.

To run the demo, execute `make` then `./demo`. (You will need to find another
way to compile on Windows/non-Unix.)
